# OutputNode Image/Video Display Fix

## Problem
Output nodes were not displaying generated images and videos after flow execution.

## Root Cause
In `src/routes/(app)/workspace/flows/[id]/+page.svelte`, the FlowExecutor callback was only updating `value` and `iterationResults` fields, but **NOT** the `fileId` and `fileType` fields that are required for file-based outputs (images, videos, audio).

When `executeOutputNode` in FlowExecutor returns `{ fileId, fileType }` for file outputs, this data was not being passed to the OutputNode component's data.

## Fix Applied

### 1. Fixed FlowExecutor Callback (lines 154-160)
**File:** `src/routes/(app)/workspace/flows/[id]/+page.svelte`

Added handling for `fileId` and `fileType` in the status update callback:

```typescript
// Update fileId and fileType for file outputs (images/videos/audio)
if (result?.fileId !== undefined) {
    updateData.fileId = result.fileId;
}
if (result?.fileType !== undefined) {
    updateData.fileType = result.fileType;
}
```

### 2. Enhanced OutputNode Component
**File:** `src/lib/components/flows/nodes/OutputNode.svelte`

#### Added Loading States
- Shows animated skeleton loader while images load
- Smooth transition from loading to loaded state

#### Added Error Handling
- Displays user-friendly error messages if image/video fails to load
- Console logging for debugging
- Separate error states for images and videos

#### Improved Accessibility
- Better alt text for images (uses node label)
- ARIA labels for video controls
- Fallback text for unsupported browsers

#### Added Download Functionality
- Download button in node header for images/videos/audio
- Download button in lightbox modal for convenient downloading
- Smart file naming using node label and proper file extensions
- Fetches MIME type to determine correct file extension (e.g., .png, .jpg, .mp4)

#### Added Debug Logging
- Logs when fileId and fileType are received
- Logs errors when media fails to load

## Additional Fixes

### 3. Clearing Execution History (lines 97-101)
Added `fileId` and `fileType` to clear operations so media outputs are properly cleared.

### 4. Loading Execution History (lines 281-289)
Added `fileId` and `fileType` restoration when loading historical execution results so that saved media outputs are displayed when viewing past executions.

## Files Changed
1. `src/routes/(app)/workspace/flows/[id]/+page.svelte` - Fixed data flow, clear function, and history loading
2. `src/lib/components/flows/nodes/OutputNode.svelte` - Enhanced UI/UX with download and error handling

## Testing
After this fix, when a flow generates an image/video:
1. The `fileId` and `fileType` will be properly set in the OutputNode data
2. The image/video will display in the node preview
3. Users can click to view in fullscreen lightbox
4. Loading states and errors are handled gracefully
5. Console logs will show the file data being received

## Debug Information
Check browser console for these logs:
- `ðŸ“¤ OutputNode [id]: Received file data` - Confirms file data received
- `âš¡ Updating output node [id] with result from [sourceId]` - FlowExecutor updates
- Error logs if media fails to load with fileUrl
