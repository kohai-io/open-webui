# Flow Execution History Feature

## Overview

Following Open WebUI's architecture patterns (specifically the Chat persistence model), we've implemented comprehensive execution history tracking for flows. This allows users to review past executions, analyze performance, debug failures, and track flow usage over time.

## Architecture

### Backend

#### Database Model (`backend/open_webui/models/flow_executions.py`)

```python
class FlowExecution(Base):
    __tablename__ = "flow_execution"
    
    id = Column(String, primary_key=True)
    flow_id = Column(String)
    user_id = Column(String)
    
    status = Column(String)  # success, error, aborted
    inputs = Column(JSON, nullable=True)
    outputs = Column(JSON, nullable=True)
    node_results = Column(JSON, nullable=True)
    errors = Column(JSON, nullable=True)
    
    execution_time = Column(BigInteger)  # milliseconds
    created_at = Column(BigInteger)  # Unix timestamp
    
    meta = Column(JSON, server_default="{}")
```

**Indexes for performance:**
- `flow_execution_flow_id_created_at_idx` - Query executions by flow
- `flow_execution_user_id_created_at_idx` - Query user's executions
- `flow_execution_flow_id_status_idx` - Filter by status

#### Database Migration

**File:** `backend/open_webui/migrations/versions/a2c5b3d7e4f8_add_flow_execution_table.py`

Automatically creates the table when the backend starts. Follows Alembic migration pattern used by Open WebUI.

#### API Endpoints (`backend/open_webui/routers/flows.py`)

Following RESTful patterns from the Chat API:

1. **POST `/api/v1/flows/{flow_id}/executions`**
   - Save execution result
   - Auto-called after each flow run
   - Requires authentication
   - Verifies user owns the flow

2. **GET `/api/v1/flows/{flow_id}/executions`**
   - List execution history (paginated, 60 per page)
   - Sorted by created_at descending
   - Returns summary data (no full results)

3. **GET `/api/v1/flows/{flow_id}/executions/stats`**
   - Get execution statistics
   - Total runs, success/error/abort counts
   - Average execution time
   - Last execution timestamp

4. **GET `/api/v1/flows/{flow_id}/executions/{execution_id}`**
   - Get full details of specific execution
   - Includes all node results and errors

5. **DELETE `/api/v1/flows/{flow_id}/executions/{execution_id}`**
   - Delete specific execution
   - User must own the flow

6. **DELETE `/api/v1/flows/{flow_id}/executions`**
   - Delete all executions for a flow
   - User must own the flow

**Helper Method:**
- `delete_old_executions_by_flow_id(flow_id, keep_count=50)` - Cleanup old executions

### Frontend

#### API Client (`src/lib/apis/flows/executions.ts`)

TypeScript client matching backend endpoints:

```typescript
interface FlowExecutionResult {
    flow_id: string;
    status: 'success' | 'error' | 'aborted';
    inputs?: Record<string, any>;
    outputs?: Record<string, any>;
    node_results?: Record<string, any>;
    errors?: Record<string, string>;
    execution_time: number;
}
```

Functions:
- `saveFlowExecution()` - Save execution result
- `getFlowExecutions()` - Get paginated list
- `getFlowExecutionStats()` - Get statistics
- `getFlowExecutionById()` - Get specific execution
- `deleteFlowExecution()` - Delete one
- `deleteAllFlowExecutions()` - Delete all

#### Auto-Save Integration

**Modified:** `src/routes/(app)/workspace/flows/[id]/+page.svelte`

Execution results are automatically saved after each flow run:

```typescript
// After successful execution
await saveFlowExecution(token, flowId, {
    flow_id: flowId,
    status: result.status,
    outputs: result.nodeResults,
    node_results: result.nodeResults,
    errors: result.errors,
    execution_time: result.executionTime
});
```

Failures and aborts are also saved for debugging.

#### Execution History Panel

**Component:** `src/lib/components/flows/panels/ExecutionHistory.svelte`

Features:
- **Statistics Dashboard**
  - Success rate percentage
  - Average execution time
  - Total run count
  
- **Execution List**
  - Status badges (✓ success, ✗ error, ⊘ aborted)
  - Execution timestamp
  - Duration in ms/seconds
  - Color-coded by status
  
- **Actions**
  - Delete individual executions
  - Close panel

**Integration:** Side panel that slides in from the right when "History" button is clicked.

## Design Decisions

### Why Follow Chat Architecture?

1. **Consistency** - Users familiar with chat history will understand flow history
2. **Proven Pattern** - Chat persistence is battle-tested in Open WebUI
3. **Scalability** - Separate table handles high execution volumes
4. **Queryability** - Easy to add analytics, filtering, search later

### Why Separate Table vs Embedded in Flow?

**Separate FlowExecution table was chosen because:**
- ✅ Better pagination (60 records at a time)
- ✅ Can query across all flows for user
- ✅ Doesn't bloat flow records
- ✅ Easy to add indexes for performance
- ✅ Can aggregate statistics efficiently
- ✅ Easier to implement cleanup (keep last 50)

**vs. Embedded in Flow.meta:**
- ❌ Flow records grow unbounded
- ❌ No pagination
- ❌ Can't query/aggregate easily
- ❌ No indexes

### Data Stored

**Full execution context saved:**
- All node results (for debugging)
- Execution errors (for troubleshooting)
- Execution time (for performance analysis)
- Status (for success rate tracking)

**NOT stored currently:**
- Input node values (could be added)
- Intermediate streaming data
- Model API responses (only final results)

## Usage

### User Workflow

1. **Create/Edit Flow** - Design the workflow
2. **Run Flow** - Execute with "Run Flow" button
3. **Auto-Save** - Execution saved to history automatically
4. **View History** - Click "History" button to open panel
5. **Review Stats** - See success rate and performance
6. **Debug Failures** - Check error messages from failed runs
7. **Delete Old Runs** - Clean up execution history

### For Developers

**To query execution history programmatically:**

```typescript
import { getFlowExecutions, getFlowExecutionStats } from '$lib/apis/flows/executions';

// Get recent executions
const executions = await getFlowExecutions(token, flowId, 1);

// Get statistics
const stats = await getFlowExecutionStats(token, flowId);
console.log(`Success rate: ${stats.success_count / stats.total_executions * 100}%`);
```

**To implement cleanup:**

```python
from open_webui.models.flow_executions import FlowExecutions

# Keep only last 50 executions
FlowExecutions.delete_old_executions_by_flow_id(flow_id, keep_count=50)
```

## Performance Considerations

### Database Indexes

Three indexes ensure fast queries:
1. `(flow_id, created_at)` - Get executions for a flow ordered by time
2. `(user_id, created_at)` - Get user's executions across all flows
3. `(flow_id, status)` - Filter by success/error/abort

### Pagination

Following Open WebUI patterns:
- Default: 60 records per page
- Sorted by `created_at DESC` (newest first)
- Client requests additional pages as needed

### Storage

**Considerations:**
- Each execution: ~1-10 KB (depends on node results size)
- 1000 executions ≈ 1-10 MB
- Recommend periodic cleanup for high-volume flows

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 1 (Completed)
- ✅ Basic execution tracking
- ✅ Success/error/abort status
- ✅ Execution time tracking
- ✅ Statistics dashboard
- ✅ History panel UI

### Phase 2 (Potential)
- [ ] Search/filter executions
- [ ] Export execution history
- [ ] Compare executions side-by-side
- [ ] Execution replay (re-run with same inputs)
- [ ] Execution notes/annotations

### Phase 3 (Advanced)
- [ ] Execution analytics dashboard
- [ ] Performance trends over time
- [ ] Alert on failure threshold
- [ ] Cost tracking (token usage)
- [ ] Scheduled cleanup automation

## Migration

**Running the migration:**

```bash
# Backend automatically runs migrations on startup
cd backend
./start.sh
```

**Manual migration:**

```bash
cd backend
alembic upgrade head
```

**Rollback if needed:**

```bash
alembic downgrade -1
```

## Testing

### Manual Testing

1. **Create a simple flow:**
   - Input node: "Tell me a joke"
   - Model node: Select any model
   - Output node

2. **Run multiple times:**
   - Successful runs
   - Force an error (disconnect model)
   - Abort mid-execution

3. **Check history panel:**
   - Verify all executions appear
   - Check statistics are correct
   - Delete an execution
   - Verify timestamps are correct

### API Testing

```bash
# Get executions for a flow
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/api/v1/flows/{flow_id}/executions" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}"

# Get statistics
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/api/v1/flows/{flow_id}/executions/stats" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Executions not saving?

**Check:**
1. Migration ran successfully (`alembic current`)
2. No errors in backend logs
3. User has permission to flow
4. Network tab shows POST to `/executions` endpoint

### History panel empty?

**Check:**
1. Run the flow at least once
2. No errors in browser console
3. API returns data (check Network tab)
4. Timestamps are valid (multiply by 1000 for JS Date)

### Performance issues?

**Solutions:**
1. Run cleanup: `delete_old_executions_by_flow_id()`
2. Check database indexes exist
3. Reduce pagination limit if needed
4. Consider archiving old executions
